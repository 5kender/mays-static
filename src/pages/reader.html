                        <h4>Just received this letter at my doorstep. Definitely made me chuckle and glad to see people like this are still around.</h4>
                        <p>I’m interested to know what kind of books high school students are required to read in Swiss schools? Is there some list that applies to all schools across cantons, or each cantons (or even schools) can choose their own?<br>
                            Thank you for your help!
                        </p>
